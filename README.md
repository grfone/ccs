# CCS PREDICTIONS

Note that you may find additional options for running your experiments
by consulting the `help` option of the Python scripts. E.g.:
```bash
$(PYTHON_INTERPRETER) ccs/main.py --help
# usage: main.py [-h] [-P] [-N]
# 
# This is the parser for the CCS project
# 
# options:
#   -h, --help           show this help message and exit
#   -P, --preanalysis    perform the preanalysis of the dataset
#   -N, --normalization  use normalization during the preanalysis
```
